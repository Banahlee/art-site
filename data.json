    "bio": "Rhonda Shakur Carter is a native of California, presently residing in Arizona. She is a self-taught artist, she has loved to draw all her life, since coloring books were 10 cents and there were only 6 colors in the crayon box. Her original works are inspired by the places she's been, from the experiences she's received in life, good and bad; the people, her family, real friends and nature. She loves creating and designing just about everything!",
